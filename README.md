# How to run this
- install Anaconda
  - (https://www.anaconda.com/docs/getting-started/anaconda/install)
- create conda environment with python 3.9
  - run `conda create --name fcgformer python=3.9` in the terminal
- activate the environment
  - `conda activate fcgformer`
- install required libraries
  - for everything except pytorch, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  - install pytorch
    - easiest: `pip install torch torchvision torchaudio` (this will run the model on the CPU)
    - (optionally) if you have an nvidia GPU, you can look online how to install the correct version for your gpu and operating system
      - this will make the model training much faster, but is not required if you just want to use the already trained model, which by default is downloaded from the internet
  - sign up to https://huggingface.co/
  - create a huggingface access token so that you can authorize your installation to download the dataset / trained model from huggingface
    - https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens/new?tokenType=read
  - run `huggingface-cli login` and enter the access token you created
  - open and try running the jupyter notebook `notebook.ipynb`
    - if you're using vscode, this can be opened and run via vscode
    - if not, run `jupyter lab` and it should open a programming environment in your browser where you can run the notebook.
